# BarcodeSwapping2017

This repo contains the Supplementary Files for the paper **Detection and Removal of Barcode Swapping in Single-Cell RNA-seq data**.

To generate the .html file, you first need to download the data, which can be done by changing your directory to that which contains this file,
then running the get_data.sh file. Then you can compile the .Rmd file, either using RStudio, or rmarkdown::render(). This step takes
around 20 minutes on a 2017 MacBook Pro.
